#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One way I can ensure my projects are not only secure but also functional is by fully understanding the requirements before starting. Understanding the requirements is important because it lays the foundation for the project and is crucial when creating test cases later. Another important step is to test unbiasedly. I say this because, as a programmer, it’s hard to find flaws in something you’ve spent hours or even weeks working on. Some test that can be used to ensure functionality are unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Additioanlly manual testing is also a good way to test from a users prespective and catch issues automated test may miss or specific edge cases.

#How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs, it is important when conducting the interview to actively listen to what they're asking for, take detailed notes, to be refrenced later, and ask follow up question for clarity. After gathering all neccesary information the user needs will be translated into system requirements, such as "the system should do TASK". These requiremnts will used as a guide when building the program incrementally. This enmsures its built and tested with the user needs as a focal point.
