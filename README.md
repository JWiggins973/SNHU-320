How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One way I can ensure my projects are not only secure but also functional is by fully understanding the requirements before starting. Understanding the requirements is important because it lays the foundation for the project and is crucial when creating test cases later. Another important step is to test unbiasedly. I say this because, as a programmer, it’s hard to find flaws in something you’ve spent hours or even weeks working on. Some tests that can be used to ensure functionality are unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Additionally, manual testing is also a good way to test from a user’s perspective and catch issues that automated tests may miss or specific edge cases.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

To interpret user needs, it is important during the interview to actively listen to what they are asking for, take detailed notes to reference later, and ask follow-up questions for clarity. After gathering all necessary information, the user needs are translated into system requirements, such as “the system should do TASK.” These requirements are used as a guide when building the program incrementally. This ensures it is built and tested with the user’s needs as a focal point.

How do I approach designing software?

The approach to designing software begins with thoroughly understanding the system requirements and constraints. The next step involves outlining the system architecture using tools like UML diagrams to visualize how different parts interact. Once I have a clear structure of the system, I break the project down into smaller pieces, prioritizing the most important ones first to streamline development and testing. Next, I begin programming and testing incrementally, ensuring each part works correctly before moving on to the next.
