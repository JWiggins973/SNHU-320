#How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

One way I can ensure my projects are not only secure but also functional is by fully understanding the requirements before starting. Understanding the requirements is important because it lays the foundation for the project and is crucial when creating test cases later. Another important step is to test unbiasedly. I say this because, as a programmer, it’s hard to find flaws in something you’ve spent hours or even weeks working on. Some test that can be used to ensure functionality are unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Additioanlly manual testing is also a good way to test from a users prespective and catch issues automated test may miss or specific edge cases.
